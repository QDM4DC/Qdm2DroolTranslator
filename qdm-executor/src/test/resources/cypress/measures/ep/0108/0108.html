                  <div style="width:660px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:auto"><pre>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the more common chronic conditions of childhood. Children with ADHD may experience significant functional problems, such as school difficulties, academic underachievement, troublesome relationships with family members and peers and behavioral problems (American Academy of Pediatrics 2000). Given the high prevalence of ADHD among school-aged children (4 to 12 percent), primary care clinicians will encounter children with ADHD in their practices regularly and should have a strategy for diagnosing and long-term management of this condition (American Academy of Pediatrics 2001).

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) clinical practice guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of children diagnosed with ADHD. Two treatment approaches are recognized for efficacy: stimulant medication therapy or behavior therapy. Despite data showing that stimulant medications are safe, there are widespread misunderstandings about the safety and use of these drugs. Those used to treat ADHD have known side effects and, like all medications, need to be closely monitored (American Academy of Pediatrics 2001).

Systematic monitoring of dosage and side-effects for children on stimulants is recommended in order to target any adverse effects (American Academy of Pediatrics 2001). Alternatively, a child may respond poorly to stimulant medication because of an undiagnosed co-morbid condition, the emergence of psychosocial stressors or noncompliance (Smucker and Hedayat 2001). The AAP clinical guideline recommends that clinicians evaluate the original diagnosis when a child does not meet target outcomes, in addition to treatment adherence. Assessment of target outcomes is based upon a systematic follow-up for the child with ADHD (American Academy of Pediatrics 2000).</pre></div>

Primary care clinicians should establish a management program that recognizes ADHD as a chronic condition (strength of evidence: good; strength of recommendation: strong). 

The treating clinician, parents, and the child, in collaboration with school personnel, should specify appropriate target outcomes to guide management (strength of evidence: good; strength of recommendation: strong). 

The clinician should recommend stimulant medication (strength of evidence: good) and/or behavior therapy (strength of evidence: fair), as appropriate, to improve target outcomes in children with ADHD (strength of recommendation: strong). 

When the selected management for a child with ADHD has not met target outcomes, clinicians should evaluate the original diagnosis, use of all appropriate treatments, adherence to the treatment plan, and presence of coexisting conditions (strength of evidence: weak; strength of recommendation: strong).

The clinician should periodically provide a systematic follow-up for the child with ADHD. Monitoring should be directed to target outcomes and adverse effects by obtaining specific information from parents, teachers, and the child (strength of evidence: fair; strength of recommendation: strong).</pre></div>
